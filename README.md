# Work-Day-Scheduler

# Project Description

This is a project that lets the user add events to a calendar. This is great for someone who has a busy work-week and 
needs to keep track of their schedule. It is color-coded as well to make it even easier: red is for the present day, grey is for past events, and green is for upcoming events.
